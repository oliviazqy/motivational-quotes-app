# Motivational Quotes App

### `🌟 Why this project?`

I deeply believe that taking care of our mental health is one of the most important things we can do. A close friend of mine has struggled with mental health challenges, and witnessing their journey has profoundly impacted me. It opened my eyes to both the difficulties individuals face and the vital need for accessible, compassionate support. 

This project is a small step in that direction — offering encouragement, hope, and a moment of positivity to anyone who might need it.
